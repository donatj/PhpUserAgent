## What It Is

A simple, streamlined PHP user-agent parser!

Licensed under the MIT license: http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php


## Why Use This

You have your choice in user-agent parsers. This one detects **all modern browsers** in a very light, quick, understandable fashion. 
It is less than 200 lines of code, and consists of just three regular expressions!
It can also correctly identify exotic versions of IE others fail on.

It offers 100% unit test coverage, is installable via Composer, and is very easy to use.

## What It Does Not Do

### OS Versions

User-agent strings **are not** a reliable source of OS Version!

- Many agents simply don't send the information. 
- Others provide varying levels of accuracy.
- Parsing Windows versions alone almost nearly doubles the size of the code.

I'm much more interested in keeping this thing *tiny* and accurate than adding nichÃ© features and would rather focus on things that can be **done well**.

All that said, there is the start of a [branch to do it](https://github.com/donatj/PhpUserAgent/tree/os_version_detection) I created for a client if you want to poke it, I update it from time to time, but frankly if you need to *reliably detect OS Version*, using user-agent isn't the way to do it. I'd go with JavaScript.

## Requirements
